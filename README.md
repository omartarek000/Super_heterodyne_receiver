# Super_heterodyne_receiver
## how we implemented the super_heterodyne receiver
The purpose of this project is to simulate the basic components of an analog communication system using 
MATLAB programming. Specifically, an AM modulator and a corresponding super-heterodyne receiver 
will be simulated using radio-station generated signals.


## the components :
1. AM Modulator
2. RF stage
3. Mixer which in the electronics context : oscillator
4. IF stage
5. baseband detection



we will pass throught each step to implement each of the components and the stages into matlab code
